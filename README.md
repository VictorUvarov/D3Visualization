# D3 Rotating Globe with Location Marker
This is a D3 (v4) based animated orthographic globe which alows you to plot markers from a given set of geo coordinates. This solution also allows you to set spinning speed and tilt shift parameter in a config object.

Questions we are answering:
- How many Gold Medals per country?
- How many Silver Medals per country?
- How many Bronze medals per country?

Features to add:
- Make it so when you click a country it pauses the animation until you unclick the country
- Clicking a country pulls up the information for that country
- Globe can be sped up and slowed down with mouse
- Highlight the country with the most golds that year.
